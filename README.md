# Projects
These are various projects which I've performed to upskill my capabilities as a Datascientist. 
Projects are spreadout on various different sections of Data Science, like Data Analysis, Data Exploration, Machine Learning Modelling and Deep Neural Networks. 

## Business Case Studies with Machine Learnnig algorithms
1. [Human Resource Department Project](https://github.com/ayushs0911/Projects/blob/main/HR%20Department:%20Attrition%20Prediction.ipynb) <br>
  Constructed Machine learning models to do classfication analysis to determine **whether employee will leave company or not**.<br>
  **Tools used**:
    - Libraries like Pandas, Nunpy, Tensorflow, Sklearn etc 
    - Data Exploration, Data cleaning and Data cleaning. 
    - Used ANOVA and ChiSquare test to check the dependency of variables 
    - Algorithms used : Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classification and Artificial Neural Networks.
