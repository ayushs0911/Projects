##Emotion Detection 

**Problem Statement** : <br>
- Emotion detection is a problem in deep learning where the goal is to identify the emotion expressed in a given text, image, or speech signal.
- The task is to classify the emotion into one of several categories, such as happiness, sadness, anger, fear, surprise, or neutral. Emotion detection has applications in a variety of fields, including psychology, market research, social media analysis, and customer service. 
- The challenge lies in accurately capturing the nuances and complexities of human emotions, which can vary widely across individuals, cultures, and contexts. 
- Deep learning approaches, such as CNNs, RNNs, and transformer-based models, have shown promising results in solving this problem by leveraging large amounts of labeled data and powerful computational resources.<br>
